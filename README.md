# Paper Acceptance:
This work has been accepted for presentation at EASE 2025 (International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering). The paper, titled “Exploring Zero-Shot App Reviews Classification by ChatGPT: Challenges and Potential,” will appear in the official conference proceedings.


This project demonstrates the use of GPT4o_mini zero-shot learning capabilities to classify app reviews into four categories: functional requirements, non-functional requirements, both, or neither. Without any task-specific training, ChatGPT achieved an F1 score of 0.84 on a diverse, expert-annotated dataset.
 
In addition to performance evaluation, we analyzed misclassification patterns with respect to review readability and length. We also benchmarked ChatGPT's performance against traditional machine learning models—including Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression, and Boosting algorithms—which require large amounts of domain-specific labeled data, often expensive and time-consuming to curate.
 
This approach offers a practical, low-cost alternative for teams without the resources to build and maintain custom classifiers.
