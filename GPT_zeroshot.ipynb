I was also very happy to see we can now hude our stories from certain people! But I sometimes have a problem with replying to photos and I have the latest version of Whatsapp and it still doesn't work. I hope the bug gets fixed. Other than that, great app!\u001b[0m\n",

For example when it comes to status, you have added so much features and its quiet to find someone's status cause you've removed the search bar.

I've gone through countless cables in the past, but this one seems like it's built to last. It's been through some tough handling, and it's still as good as new.

May 30,2023 mesmerized that's a new word for this game. I was working at the game and lost all track of time, it was fun 😊. 11/15/23. Recently I've been playing and it has a lot of stuff that I buy .

If I'll loose regardless of effort because the game has chosen to scam players, then what's the point in playing? I still stand with the fact that it pays for this game to be entirely deleted. It doesn't even motivate me to while away time anymore. I get infuriated when I see the game on my phone and know that it's an absolute waste.\u001b[0m\n"
